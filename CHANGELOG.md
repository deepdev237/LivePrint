### Core Components

#### LiveBPCore Module
- `FLiveBPDataTypes` - Core data structures for collaboration messages
- `FLiveBPMUEIntegration` - Multi-User Editing transport layer integration
- `FLiveBPLockManager` - Node-level locking with automatic expiry and conflict resolution
- `FLiveBPMessageThrottler` - Advanced rate limiting with per-user quotas
- `FLiveBPPerformanceMonitor` - Comprehensive metrics and performance tracking
- `ULiveBPNotificationSystem` - Event broadcasting and user activity notifications  
- `FLiveBPTestFramework` - Automated testing and validation system
- `FLiveBPUtils` - Serialization, validation, and utility functions

#### LiveBPEditor Module
- `ULiveBPEditorSubsystem` - Main coordination system and Blueprint integration
- `ULiveBPSettings` - Configuration system with 40+ customizable options
- `SLiveBPGraphEditor` - Custom SGraphEditor with real-time collaborative overlays
- `FLiveBPBlueprintEditorMode` - Blueprint editor customization and tab factories
- `SLiveBPCollaborationPanel` - Live diagnostics and monitoring interface
- `FLiveBPConsoleCommands` - Debug console commands for development

### Message Types
- **Wire Preview Messages**: Real-time wire drag coordinates and states
- **Node Operation Messages**: Add/delete/move operations with full serialization
- **Pin Connection Messages**: Connect/disconnect operations with validation
- **Lock Messages**: Node lock requests, releases, and status updates
- **User Presence Messages**: User activity, cursor position, and status updates

### Performance Characteristics
- **Wire Previews**: 10Hz update rate (100ms intervals) with throttling
- **Structural Changes**: Sub-50ms target latency for critical operations
- **Message Throughling**: Configurable per-user rate limits (5-50 msg/s)
- **Lock Timeouts**: 30-second default with configurable expiry
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient message pooling and automatic cleanup

### Configuration Profiles
- **Development**: High update rates, full logging, all features enabled
- **Production**: Conservative rates, minimal logging, essential features only
- **High-Performance**: Optimized for large teams with strict throttling
- **Educational**: Enhanced visual feedback for learning environments
- **Low-Bandwidth**: Minimal feature set for constrained networks

### Testing Coverage
- **Serialization Tests**: Message encoding/decoding validation
- **Throttling Tests**: Rate limiting and quota enforcement
- **Lock Management Tests**: Conflict resolution and timeout handling
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput validation
- **Network Simulation**: Artificial latency and packet loss testing

### Console Commands
- `LiveBP.Help` - Show all available commands
- `LiveBP.Debug.ShowStats` - Display performance statistics
- `LiveBP.Debug.TestConnection` - Test MUE connection status
- `LiveBP.Debug.ClearLocks` - Clear all node locks (admin)
- `LiveBP.Debug.SimulateLatency` - Add artificial network latency
- `LiveBP.Debug.RunTests` - Execute full test suite
- `LiveBP.Debug.ToggleDebugMode` - Toggle debug visualization
- `LiveBP.Debug.DumpMessages` - Show recent message history

### Known Limitations
- Maximum 16 concurrent users (Concert limitation)
- Large graphs (1000+ nodes) may impact performance
- Some Blueprint node types not yet fully supported
- Cross-engine version compatibility not guaranteed
- Requires UE 5.5+ and Multi-User Editing plugin

### Installation Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.5 or later
- Multi-User Editing plugin enabled
- Concert plugin enabled
- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or Xcode (Mac) for building
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for development

### Network Requirements
- TCP/IP network connectivity between clients
- Concert server running and accessible
- Recommended: <100ms network latency between clients
- Bandwidth: ~10-50 KB/s per active collaboration session
